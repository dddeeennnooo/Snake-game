# Snake Game (Command Line Version)

This is a simple Snake game written in C by me and my classmate Matej. The game runs entirely in the command prompt/terminal window and uses ASCII characters for graphics.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Arrow key controls
- Score tracking
- Command line interface

## How to Run

1. **Compile the code** using a C compiler like `gcc`:

   ```bash
   gcc snake.c -o snake
